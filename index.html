<p>This deliverable establishes guidelines for drafting Core Vocabularies and Application Profiles. It has been considered that defining and aligning common guidelines is beneficial for – at least – the following reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_branding"><a class="anchor" href="#_branding"></a>1.5.1. Branding</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SEMIC aims to present these standards as one large group under a single brand. Such branding will only work when all standards use the same modelling approach, follow the same naming conventions, notations, guidelines and rules, and are published with identical documentation output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ownership_and_governance"><a class="anchor" href="#_ownership_and_governance"></a>1.5.2. Ownership and governance.</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, SEMIC will make sure it has ownership over the vocabularies and can therefore govern them in a timely manner aligned with stakeholders' needs. This is intended to lead to a policy with less dependence on external vocabularies and external organisations. For this reason, own namespace(s) will be claimed, and the core concepts and relationships needed will be defined using these own namespace(s).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pragmatism_and_ease_of_use"><a class="anchor" href="#_pragmatism_and_ease_of_use"></a>1.5.3. Pragmatism and ease of use</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previous versions of these standards were only oriented to the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. However, these technologies are not yet universally understood nor used and are considered to be too difficult. Hence, having unified guidelines and good practice advice is essential for keeping the Core Vocabularies pragmatic and straightforward. Besides, the majority of users use established data formats such as XML and JSON. As far as these contexts are concerned, the present guidelines also include XML Schema and detailed guidelines on how to use and implement these in alignment with the semantic web-oriented assets (including JSON Schema guidelines for the future as soon as they will come to a stable version).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_broad_applicability"><a class="anchor" href="#_broad_applicability"></a>1.5.4. Broad applicability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These standards should have general applicability. Accordingly, the Core Vocabularies aim is to define simplified, reusable, and extensible data models that capture only the fundamental characteristics in a context-neutral manner.
This will lead to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>minimal ontological commitment, meaning that semantics which would lead to inferences/deductions that could limit reuse while being too specific, will not be added;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limited constraints; constraints are better defined at the application level layer.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purpose of knowledge sharing and interoperation between programs
based on a shared conceptualisation, proposes a set of preliminary
<em>design criteria</em> a formal ontology should follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Clarity</em>. An ontology should communicate the purpose and meaning of
defined terms. Definitions should be objective and independent of social
and computational context even if the underlying motivations arise from
them. Formalism is the means to this end, and when possible, the logical
formulation should be provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Coherence</em>. Ontology should permit inferences that are consistent
with the definitions. At the least, the defining axioms should be
logically consistent. Coherence should also apply to the concepts that
are defined informally, such as those described in natural language
documentation and examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Extensibility</em>. Ontology should be designed to anticipate the uses of
the shared vocabulary. It should offer a conceptual foundation for a
range of anticipated tasks and the representation should be crafted so
that one can extend and specialise the ontology monotonically. This
feature supports and encourages reuse and further specialisations of
ontologies and creation of the application profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Minimal encoding bias</em>. The conceptualisation should be specified at
the knowledge level without depending on a particular symbol-level
encoding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Minimal ontological commitment</em>. Ontology should require the minimal
ontological commitment sufficient to support the intended knowledge
sharing activities. Ontology should make as few claims as possible about
the world being modelled, allowing the parties committed to the ontology
freedom specialise and instantiate the ontology as needed. An
ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary,
with which queries and assertions are exchanged between agents, in a
coherent and consistent manner. We say that an agent commits to an
ontology if its behaviour is consistent with the definitions in the
ontology .</p>

<h3 id="sec:separation-conceprns"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:separation-conceprns"></a>2.1. Separation of concerns</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The successful application of an ontology or the development of an
ontology-based system depends not just on building a good ontology but
also on fitting this into an appropriate development process. All
computing information models suffer from a semantic schizophrenia. On
the one hand, the model represents the domain; on the other hand, it
represents the implemented system, which then represents the domain.
These different representation requirements place different demands upon
its structure .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the common ways to manage this problem is a separation of
concerns. OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA) <a href="#MDA">[MDA]</a> is a well-documented
structure where a model is built for each concern and this is
transformed into specific artefacts each addressing a different concern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Transformation</em> deals with producing different models, viewpoints, or
artefacts from a model based on a transformation pattern. In general,
transformation can be used to produce one representation from another,
or to cross levels of abstraction or architectural layers .</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:layers-components"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:layers-components"></a>2.2. Layers and components</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture is organised in <em>horizontal layers</em> and vertically
slicing <em>components</em>. The <em>components</em> reflect the organisation of the
formal ontology based on a logical content division of the UML
conceptual model into packages and modules. This division increases the
maintainability of entire content. The models and their components are
not disconnected from one another. The relations between them are
represented in Figure #fig:components[1] where each component is
represented as an UML package. The conceptual model serves as the single
source of truth, from which the three components of the formal model are
derived. Each of these components can be further divided into modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main ontology packages are: the <em>core ontology</em>, <em>data shapes</em>, and
<em>formal ontology restrictions</em>. These formal modules are derived from
the conceptual model through model transformations as described in
Section #sec:process-approach<a id="sec:process-approach"></a> following the
rules laid out in .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>core ontology</em> is the foundational, and serves as a backbone for
the other components. It establishes the identifiers and the basic
definitions of classes and properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>data shapes</em> represent constraints on how the core ontology can be
instantiated and the set of controlled value lists associated to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>formal ontology restrictions</em> cover intensional class and property
definitions used for deriving additional knowledge from factual
information. Both, the data shapes and the ontology restrictions are
defined as extensions that are flashing out the core ontology which
plays, in this case the role of a backbone.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture distinguishes the following layers: the <em>conceptual
layer</em>, <em>core definition layer</em>, <em>validation layer</em> and <em>reasoning
layer</em>. These <em>layers</em> can be thought of as formal languages with
well-defined boundaries and extents. The diagram in Figure
#fig:layers[2] presents the organisation the ontology layers along two
axes: <em>expressivity</em> and <em>detail</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>expressivity</em> of a language is the breadth of ideas that can be
represented and communicated in that language. The more expressive the
language is, the greater the variety and quantity of ideas it can be
used to represent. The design of a language and its formalism involves
an inevitable trade-off between the expressive power and its
``analysability'', which translates directly into computation
difficulty. The more a formalism can express, the harder it becomes to
understand, i.e. compute, what do instances of it mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>detail</em> refers to how much description and aspects of the domain
concepts are considered. This dimension plays a pragmatic rather than
formal role. The rationale is that lower level of detail is useful and
re-usable to a wider public, but for a set of relatively simple tasks.
As the level of detail increases, the difficulty to operate on it also
increases thus the user base shrinks and the task complexity rises.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The detail axis starts, on one side, from establishing the concepts
identity, labels, natural language definitions; continues through
establishing relations and constraints; and ends, on the other side,
with formulating special logical conditions, implications and inference
rules.</p>

eProcurement ontology layers,scaledwidth=80.0%]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>conceptual layer</em> accommodates informal representation of the
business objects, places, things, actors in the ``real world'' not
representations of these things in the information system. It is
situated at the base of the diagram with lowest expressivity because it
has not formal semantics but with a wide coverage of detail. The dotted
line delimits the border between formal and informal layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the conceptual layer is situated the <em>UML conceptual model</em>, which is
described in Section #sec:uml-model[1.3]. This model is also called
<em>computation independent model</em> because it is informal and its main
purpose is to interface the domain experts with an explicit conceptual
representation of the domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the formal section of the diagram, the expert knowledge is expressed
using descriptive languages with a formal semantics (see Section
#sec:semantics[2.2]), which in this architecture are primarily OWL 2 and
SHACL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>core layer</em>, is situated in the core ontology, which has as a
primary goal to define the main concepts and relations of the ontology.
It is limited to the declarative axioms of the ontology and therefore
serves primarily for vocabulary and identity establishment. For this
reason, it is represented as having the lowest formal expressivity and
the lightest level of detail in comparison to other layers. It plays the
role of a backbone which is flashed out by other layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>validation layer</em> accommodates declarations of data shapes which
represent constraints on the instance data, i.e. the ABox (see Section
#sec:model-data[2.1]). The assertions in this layer are interpreted done
under the closed world assumption, making it possible to support
validation functionality. The SHACL shapes are situated in this layer
and are addressed in detail in Section #sec:shapes[1.5].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The validation layer is situated immediately above the core definitions,
being more expressive but also extending it with additional detail.
Therefore, it is shifted, on the detail axis, to the right towards more
detail and leaving out the simple axioms as they are already covered in
the core later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>reasoning layer</em> accommodates formal intensional definitions of the
classes and properties. In Logics, <em>intensional definition</em> gives the
meaning of a term by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for
when the term should be used. This layer is mostly formed of subclass
restrictions and complex class definitions, and as well, domain and
range specifications for properties. This layer provides assertions
necessary to support consistency checking and classification reasoning
functionalities for eProcurement ontology. The formal ontology
restrictions component is situated in this layer and is described in
Section #sec:restrictions[1.6].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like in the case of the restrictions layer, the reasoning layer
extends the core layer with higher level of detail and comprising
assertions with higher expressive power. Therefore, the simple details
rest in the core layer permitting this one to focus on other ones. For
this reason, it is depicted as shifted to the towards the right side of
detail axis.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conceptual model is represented in UML serves as the single source
of truth. Thus, the scope of this architecture is limited by what can be
expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal
statements. Each of the above functions will lead to different
interpretations of the same UML model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary application of UML for ontology design is in the
specification of class diagrams for object-oriented software. However,
UML does not have a clearly specified declarative semantics, so that it
is not possible to determine whether an ontology is consistent, or to
determine the correctness of an implementation of the ontology. Semantic
integration in such cases becomes a subjective exercise, validated only
by the opinions of the human designers involved in the integration
effort .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, UML is closer than more logic-oriented approaches to
the programming languages in which enterprise applications are
implemented. For this reason, in the current project we have decided to
develop agreements on the informal semantics of the UML-based conceptual
model. It consists of a set of explicit conventions for naming and
structuring UML elements and for transforming UML to OWL .</p>

<p>The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties
datatypes and controlled lists. It established, in a machine readable

human readable labels and descriptions. This represents a mechanism that
established a common understanding between humans and machine.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In OWL the constraints are formed at the semantic level in the way the
logic of the entire knowledge base holds together consistently. It is
not always easy or obvious how the constraints should be formed so that
they fulfil a business or application requirement. Moreover, in practice
often the kind of constraints necessary are those aiming at the surface
representation of the data. Take, XSD for example, it provides a
description of how an XML document ought to be structured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the eProcurement domain, before the RDF data is utilised as a
semantic resource, it must first respect a more formal conventions on
how it is instantiated and organised. There is a need for the XSD
counterpart for the RDF graphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</em> is a specification for validating
graph-based data against a set of conditions. It provides a concise,
uniform syntax for both describing and constraining the contents of an
RDF graph. Among others, SHACL includes features to express conditions
that constrain the number of values that a property may have, the type
of such values, numeric ranges, string matching patterns, and logical
combinations of such constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Application profiles (AP)</em> represent a set of constraints on the
logical model tying it to a particular system implementation. The
application profiles, in this project, must be expressed using SHACL
language. The approach taken by the Publications Office to develop APs
is described in . The same style should be maintained for the
eProcurement APs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AP must be conceived as extending the core ontology and fleshing the
classes and properties with node and property shapes (see ). The
constraints available in the conceptual model are generic and should be
automatically generated. However, when it comes to integration with
specific systems, these constraints may not be sufficient, possibly even
too rigid at times. Therefore, it is recommended to conceptualise the
data shapes not a single fit it all AP but rather to create specific APs
as the needs arise.</p>

<p>This component provides the rules and logical conditions for reasoning

variants of this components should be generated, one for each OWL
dialect as described in Section #sec:expressivity[2.4]. Each of these

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Simplicity</em>. Short, mnemonic URIs will not break as easily when sent
in emails and are in general easier to remember.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Stability</em>. Once you set up a URI to identify a certain resource, it
should remain this way as long as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Manageability</em>. Issue your URIs in a way that you can manage.</p>

<p>The ISA\(^2\) study on persistent URIs provides a set of

study on URI design patterns , in the context of promoting semantic
interoperability, identified good design practices for the local part of

#sec:persistence[3.2]).</p>

<li>
<p><em>Use a template</em>. Pre-defined approach to URI design, using for
example URI templates, can help organisations follow a logical structure

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avoid stating ownership</em>. The URI template above does not include the
name of the organisation or project that minted the URI .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avoid version numbers</em>. URIs should remain stable between versions
and new ones minted for new terms .</p>

<li>
<p><em>Re-use existing identifiers</em>. Where resources are already uniquely
identified, those identifiers should be incorporated into the URI .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avoid using auto-increment</em>. Minting new URIs for large datasets will
need to be automated and the process must be guaranteed to produce
unique identifiers, but not sequentially allocated .</p>

<li>
<p><em>Avoid query strings</em>. Query strings (e.g. <code>?param=value</code>) are usually
used in URLs as keys to look up terms in a database. But these

<h3 id="sec:persistence"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:persistence"></a>5.2. Persistence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2014, the ISA Programme supported an informal Task Force working on a
common policy for the management of persistent, HTTP-based URIs of EU
institutions comparable to the virtues of DOI identification scheme . A
Persistent URI Service on the <a href="http://data.europa.eu" class="bare">http://data.europa.eu</a> sub-domain was
established that is responsible for the registration and management of
persistent URI namespaces and the forwarding of HTTP requests (URI
redirection) towards the Publications Office local register for the
eProcurement ontology (see Section #sec:uri-scheme[3.3]).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Publications Office was allocated URI namespaces for usage in the
context of eProcurement ontology. Section #sec:uri-scheme[3.3] provides
the specifications on the URI structure and the local part organisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regarding URI design, the main consideration of creators should be that
when a URI is created, all its parts should be resistant to change. For
instance, locations and organisation names can change, and therefore
should not be used in URIs. First and foremost, when introducing
semantics in URIs, the strings used need to reflect what the resources
are (i.e. intrinsic characteristics such as the type or nature), not who
owns them or where they are .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating a URI, its owner can never be certain of who will be using
it and can therefore not notify every concerned individual of future
changes. It is therefore paramount that URIs are designed carefully with
the specific goal of making them persistent, in theory forever .
Persistence is a vital component of URI design. Since the local part of
a URI is under the control of the institution that owns it (in this case
Publications Office), it is up to the owners to ensure that the way they
design local IDs enables the persistence of the URI as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended to identify all eProcurement resources with URIs which
have opaque local identifiers. However, in the case of TBox resources,
such as the ontology and the data shapes, mnemonic local segments may be
used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:uri-scheme"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:uri-scheme"></a>5.3. URI scheme</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The URIs are best maintained using a predefined set of patterns and
templates. This section defines the URI templates all together forming a
URI scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple syntax is adopted to express the scheme templates in terms of
URI path patterns. A path pattern comprises a sequence of delimited
segments, such as <code>segment1/segment2/segment3</code>. Each advancement by a
segment leads to creation of a new hierarchically positioned namespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The segment denomination can be literal or variable. The literal segment
means that the value provided is constant and must appear as such in the
indicated position. The variable segments are marked by curly brackets (
\{ } ) and represent the name of the slot which must be filled with a
concrete value when a new URI is minted in the implementation process.
For example, the pattern <code>segment/{varSegment}</code> can be instantiated as
<code>segment/123</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to indicate that a path sub-sequence is optional by
wrapping it in square brackets ( [ ] ). For example
<code>segment/[{varSubSegment}/]``varSubSubSegment</code> pattern can be
instantiated either as <code>segment/abc/123</code> or <code>segment/123</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section defines templates for two dedicated PURI namespaces
corresponding roughly to TBox–ABox distinction in the ontology structure
or the model–data delimitation, which is explained in Section
#sec:model-data[2.1]. The first namespace, <em>baseVoc</em>, is dedicated to
the ontology, vocabulary and modelling artefacts; while the second,
<em>baseData</em> is foreseen to accommodate the large volume of instance data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The instance datasets are generated by a range of institutions.
Therefore, each agent should be delegated minting URIs in a controlled
and conflict free manner. One way to do that is allocate dedicated base
PURI spaces.</p>

<h2 id="sec:formal-considerations"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:formal-considerations"></a>6. Formal considerations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section addresses the aspects of logics in the eProcurement
ontology. It specifies the semantics, the relationship between the
abstract layer of the ontology and the instance data, under what
assumptions is the inference done and what level of logical formalism
should the ontology components adapt in order to maintain flexibility
and reasoning capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:model-data"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:model-data"></a>6.1. Model and data relationship</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DL ontologies are structured into two sets: <em>ABox</em> and <em>TBox</em>. The
<em>ABox</em> consists of all (class or property) instance assertions. The
<em>TBox</em> consists of all terminological axioms, i.e., of all subclass
inclusion axioms. The ABox provides information about concrete
individuals while the TBox describes general rules that hold for all
individuals. In consequence, ABoxes tend to be much larger than TBoxes .
In Figure #fig:abox-tbox[3] is depicted the delimitation and relations
between the TBox and box ABox components of the eProcurement ontology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>image::../img/ontology.png[The relationship between the data and each of
the ontology components,scaledwidth=99.0%]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To explain the relevance of each component, in Figure #fig:abox-tbox[3],
two arbitrary datasets are brought as examples. They instantiate the
core ontology, which means that they comprise of factual statements of
concrete entities of eProcurement classes. In order to ensure that the
instance data follow minimally the intended ontology design they need to
comply with a set of data shapes. Once this condition is satisfied,
then, new knowledge can be inferred from the provided facts, given the
domain inference rules. The new knowledge is mainly oriented to solve
the classification task and does not cover other types of inference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to note that the data shapes fall out of the TBox as
they serve the validation function and are based on a different set of
assumptions. First, they are interpreted under the closed world
assumption, like in XML or RDBM contexts (see Section
#sec:world-assumption[2.3]). Secondly, they follow a RDF graph based
semantics #sec:semantics[2.2].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:semantics"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:semantics"></a>6.2. Semantics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users of OWL <a href="#OWL">[OWL]</a> can actually select between two slightly different
semantics: <em>direct semantics</em> that corresponds to the Description Logics
(DL) , and <em>RDF-based semantics</em> that is based on translation of the OWL
axioms into directed graphs. In this document we assume by default the
direct semantics. In particular cases (i.e. SPARQL entailments and SHACL
data shapes) RDF-based semantics is adopted and is explicitly mentioned
in the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Description logics provide a concise language for OWL axioms and
expressions. DLs are characterised by their expressive features. The
description logic that supports all class expressions with
\(&gt;, \bot, \sqcap, \sqcup, \neg, \exists\) and
\(\forall\) is known as \(\mathcal{ALC}\) (which
originally used to be an abbreviation for Attribute Language with
Complement). For a formal introduction into DL please consult .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inverse properties are not supported by \(\mathcal{ALC}\), and
the DL we have introduced above is actually called
\(\mathcal{ALCI}\) (for \(\mathcal{ALC}\) with
inverses) . Many description logics can be defined by simply listing
their supported features. The letter \(\mathcal{S}\) is often
used as an abbreviation for the ``basic'' DL consisting of
\(\mathcal{ALC}\) extended with transitive roles (which in the
\(\mathcal{AL}\) naming scheme would be called
\(\mathcal{ALCR+}\) ).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The letter \(\mathcal{H}\) represents sub-roles (role
Hierarchies), \(\mathcal{O}\) represents nominals (nOminals),
\(\mathcal{I}\) represents inverse roles (Inverse),
\(\mathcal{N}\) represent number restrictions (Number), and
\(\mathcal{Q}\) represent qualified number restrictions
(Qualified).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The integration of a concrete domain/datatype is indicated by appending
its name in parenthesis, but sometimes a ``generic''
\(\mathcal{D}\) is used to express that some concrete
domain/datatype has been integrated. The DL corresponding to the OWL DL
ontology language includes all of these constructors and is therefore
called \(\mathcal{SHOIN(D)}\). We will use this notation when
discussing degrees of expressivity for the ontology layers in Section
#sec:expressivity[2.4].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computing all interesting logical conclusions of an OWL ontology can be
a challenging problem, and reasoning is typically multi-exponential or
even undecidable. To address this problem, the recent update OWL 2 of
the W3C standard introduced three profiles: <em>OWL EL</em>, <em>OWL RL</em>, and <em>OWL
QL</em>. These lightweight sublanguages of OWL restrict the available
modelling features in order to simplify reasoning. This has led to large
improvements in performance and scalability, which has made the OWL 2
profiles very attractive for practitioners .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, the validation data shapes are expressed using Shapes
Constraint Language (SHACL) . Its semantics is based on RDF graphs but
full RDFS inferencing is not required. SHACL processors may operate on
RDF graphs that include RDF entailments and SPARQL specific entailments
. The entailment regime specifies conditions that address the fourth
condition on extensions of basic graph pattern matching .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture delimits different concerns in Section
#sec:layers-components[1.2] in a stack of layers and assigns levels of
expressivity to each of the layers in Section #sec:expressivity[2.4].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:world-assumption"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:world-assumption"></a>6.3. Open and closed world assumptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the formal systems of logic used for knowledge representation,
reasoning is the process through which logical conclusions are derived
from a set of premises known to be true or assumed to be true by the
laws of valid inference (inference rules).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the eProcurement ontology checking consistency and deriving new
knowledge is foreseen as a valuable functionality beyond the knowledge
representation and interoperability establishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inferencing is impacted by what is assumed about the knowledge base. The
important assumptions to consider are: (a) whether the knowledge base is
considered complete – the closed-world assumption (CWA); or (b) whether
the knowledge base (proper knowledge base) is in a state of continuous
progression – the open-world assumption (OWA) .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under the <em>closed-world assumption</em> it is the presumed that a statement
that is true is also known to be true. Therefore, conversely, what is
not currently known to be true, is false . The opposite of the
closed-world assumption is the <em>open-world assumption</em> stating that lack
of knowledge does not imply falsity. The truth value of a statement may
be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The eProcurement data is fragmented across information systems. It
represents concerns specific to different steps in the procurement
process. Performing local reasoning with such incomplete knowledge is
therefore necessary functionality for the eProcurement project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Semantic Web languages, including OWL, make the open-world assumption.
The absence of a particular statement within the web means, in
principle, that the statement has not been made explicitly yet,
irrespective of whether it would be true or not, and irrespective of
whether we believe that it would be true or not. This stance is also
very convenient for decentralised knowledge bases over the internet,
where information may be accessible, outdated, contradictory,
inaccessible or missing .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For validation purposes, in particular, a closed world assumption needs
to be made. This concerns the data shapes expressed in SHACL language.
In this case, the knowledge base must be considered complete in order to
assess whether it fulfils the imposed constraints or recommended shapes.
Therefore, everything that is not known to be true must be considered as
false.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The eProcurement data must be validated within its local context. The
data must be conformant to the information needs and aspects specific to
the procurement phase and, possibly, to the information system that
handles it. It is, therefore, foreseeable that multiple validation
schemes and application profiles have to be developed specific to
different phases and aspects of the procurement process. These schemes
must extend and flesh out the core ontology, which is the ontology
backbone, with levels of specificity and detail as necessary.</p>
