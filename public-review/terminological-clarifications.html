<h3 id="sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-conceptual-model"></a>What is a conceptual model (specification)?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A conceptual model is an abstract representation of a system and comprises well-defined concepts,
qualities or attributes, and relationships to other concepts. A system is a group of interacting or interrelated
elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
We assume that the conceptual model is expressed in UML and depicted with UML class diagrams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A conceptual model is a representation of a system that uses concepts to form said representation. A concept can be viewed
as an idea or notion, a unit of thought [<a href="references.html#ref:2" class="xref page">2</a>]. However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective,
and this definition is meant to be suggestive rather than restrictive. That is why each concept needs to be well named by providing
preferred and alternative labels and should have a clear and precise definition supported by examples and explanatory notes.
The conceptual model comprises representations of concepts, their qualities or attributes and relationships to other concepts.
Most commonly, these are association and generalisation relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conceptual model is represented in UML [<a href="references.html#ref:3" class="xref page">3</a>] and serves as the single source of truth [<a href="gc-conceptual-model-conventions.html#sec:cmc-r1" class="xref page">rule CMC-R1</a>].
The scope of this architecture is limited by what can be expressed in UML and how that information is utilised to generate formal statements.
Each of the above concerns will lead to different interpretations of the same UML model [<a href="gc-conceptual-model-conventions.html#sec:cmc-r2" class="xref page">rule CMC-R2</a>].
The motivation behind the choice for a graphical language, i.e. UML, for the master representation of the conceptual model,
is also driven by the fact that interactions and discussions within a Working Group for a data specification are often driven by
a graphical representation. Therefore, naturally, editors first create the graphical representation of the proposed resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With UML as the starting and ultimate source of truth, the update process is easier to perform as it only has to be done in a single place.
The other representations are automatically derived from the conceptual model; the maintenance is less error-prone, uniform and easy
[<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:transformation" class="xref page">Transformation</a>].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-an-ontology"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-an-ontology"></a>What is an ontology (specification)?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
An ontology is a description (like a formal specification) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent
or a community of agents (e.g. domain experts) for a given domain of discourse [<a href="references.html#ref:4" class="xref page">4</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between
the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse [<a href="references.html#ref:5" class="xref page">5</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
The ontology constitutes the formal (machine-readable) definition of concepts. Although the languages for expressing ontologies
could be very expressive, we want to keep it very light and simple, from the formal point of view [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r1" class="xref page">rule SC-R1</a>],
with minimal detail and level of expressivity [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r2" class="xref page">rule SC-R2</a>]. In the SEMIC context,
we only consider lightweight ontologies [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r2" class="xref page">rule SC-R2</a>]. Therefore, sometimes this aspect
will be emphasised as “lightweight ontology”, but often, it will be implicitly referred to simply as “ontology”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We assume that the ontology is expressed in OWL 2 language [<a href="gc-semantic-conventions.html#sec:sc-r1" class="xref page">rule SC-R1</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main purpose of this component is to declare the classes, properties, datatypes and controlled lists. Each construct is established
by assigning a URI and decorating it with human-readable labels and descriptions. This represents a mechanism that establishes a common
understanding between humans and machines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-data-shape-contraint"></a>What is a data shape constraint (specification)?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A data shape constraint specification provides a set of conditions on top of an ontology, limiting how the ontology can be instantiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
The conditions and constraints that apply to a given ontology are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph.
We assume that the data shapes are expressed in SHACL language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document will refer to data shape constraint specifications as “data shapes” or “data shape specifications”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-a-specification-document"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-specification-document"></a>What is a specification document?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A (data) specification (technical) document is created with the objective of making it simple for the end-user to (a) understand
how a model encodes knowledge of a particular domain and (b) how this model can be technically adopted and used for a purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
Technically, the data specification document is the human-readable representation of an ontology, a data shape or a combination of both.
We assume that the data specification is published in HTML format (optionally, others). See, for example, the Core Person specification
[<a href="references.html#ref:6" class="xref page">6</a>] or the CPSV-AP specification [<a href="references.html#ref:7" class="xref page">7</a>].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-an-artefact"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-an-artefact"></a>What is an artefact?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A (data specification) artefact is a materialisation of a semantic data specification in a format appropriate for addressing
one or more concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
In the SEMIC context, we consider the following artefact types as primary: ontologies, data shapes, and specification documents.
For a description of various concerns addressed in the SEMIC context, please see section
[<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:separation-of-concerns-and-transformation" class="xref page">Separation of concerns in SEMIC</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, we are concerned with syntax bindings and serialisation formats (XML/XSD and JSON-LD in particular).
Still, these are not in the scope of this document and are addressed elsewhere. For more, see section
[<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:on-data-specification-and-artefact-types" class="xref page">On data specification and artefact types</a>].</p>

<h3 id="sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-semantic-data-specification"></a>What is a semantic data specification?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A semantic data specification is a union of machine- and human-readable artefacts addressing clearly defined concerns, interoperability
scope and use-cases. A semantic data specification comprises at least an ontology and a data shape (or either of them individually)
accompanied by a human-readable data specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
In the SEMIC context, two types of semantic data specification are considered: [<a href="#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification">Core Vocabulary</a>] and
[<a href="#sec:what-is-an-ap-specification">Application Profile</a>]. Occasionally, this document
will refer to semantic data specifications shortly as “data specifications”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a similar meaning, the term “semantic asset” is used in the literature (e.g. ADMS [<a href="references.html#ref:8" class="xref page">8</a>]). However, in our understanding,
the term “semantic asset” is broader than “data specification” and includes controlled vocabularies and possibly other types of assets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-a-cv-specification"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-a-cv-specification"></a>What is a Core Vocabulary (CV) specification?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
A Core Vocabulary (CV) is a basic, reusable and extensible data specification that captures the fundamental characteristics of an
entity in a context-neutral fashion. Its main objective is to provide terms to be reused in the broadest possible context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Broad context</strong> (on vocabularies)<br>
On the Semantic Web, vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as “terms”) used to describe and represent
an area of concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular application, characterise possible
relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several
thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only) [<a href="references.html#ref:9" class="xref page">9</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no clear division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology”
for a more complex and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not
necessarily used or used only in a very loose sense [<a href="references.html#ref:9" class="xref page">9</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SEMIC context</strong> (on Core Vocabularies)<br>
Formally, a Core Vocabulary encompasses a lightweight ontology, and, optionally, a (permissive) data shape specification, and it
is expressed in a condensed, comprehensive data specification document.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>CV =</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>lightweight ontology &#43;</p>

<p>See more in section [<a href="arhitectural-clarifications.html#sec:on-data-specification-and-artefact-types" class="xref page">On data specification and artefact types</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The qualifications <em>lightweight</em> and <em>permissive</em> are used to make the intention <em>to be reused in the broadest possible context</em> more
precise. More precise boundaries are defined further in this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> “Vocabularies”, in general, are not the same as “controlled vocabularies”, as they usually refer to SKOS artefacts. However,
in other contexts (similar to SEMIC), a Core Vocabulary might often be simply denoted as “vocabulary”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sec:what-is-an-ap-specification"><a class="anchor" href="#sec:what-is-an-ap-specification"></a>What is an Application Profile (AP) specification?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Definition</strong><br>
An Application Profile is a data specification to facilitate the data exchange in a well-defined  application context. It re-uses
concepts from one or more semantic data specifications while adding more specificity by identifying mandatory, recommended, and
optional elements, addressing particular application needs, and recommendations for controlled vocabularies to be used
[<a href="references.html#ref:10" class="xref page">10</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong><br>
An Application Profile (AP) is a data shape specification which addresses particular application needs (operating within some
domain or community) while providing semantic interoperability with other applications based on one or more shared ontologies
(vocabularies) [<a href="references.html#ref:11" class="xref page">11</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formally, the Application Profile encompasses (a) <u>reused</u> ontology specifications (one or many) and
(b) its <u>own</u> data shape specification. Optionally it may include (c) <u>reused</u> data shape
specifications (one or many), and (d) it may provide its <u>own</u> ontology specification to fill the ontological gaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>AP =</p>

<p>(optionally) own ontology</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SEMIC context</strong><br>
In SEMIC, Application Profiles encompass an ontology, which is largely composed of importing the reused ontologies, complemented
with an appropriate data shape specification. Terms that are introduced because of the Application Profile needs are, by preference,
added to existing Core Vocabularies. If this is not possible, an Application Profile-specific Vocabulary is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>AP =</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data specification document of an Application Profile is elaborated. It will provide the application scope and context and
documents the ontology and the data shapes through the conceptual model. It also provides additional information that stimulates
the adoption and correct usage of the AP in implementations.</p>
