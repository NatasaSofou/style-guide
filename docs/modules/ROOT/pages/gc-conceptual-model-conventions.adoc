==== UML as a single source of truth

*Statement*

_The UML conceptual model should be used as the single source of truth._

*Description*

By applying this principle, we can achieve consistency among all derived artefacts.

This implies:

* Standard representation of the UML such as XMI or EAP database
* Existence of a well-defined set of rules and conventions to transform UML model into other artefacts, which can be executed, as much as possible automatically, by a dedicated software tool or toolchain [see rule about fixed interpretation]

It is recommended that recent versions of the UML (v2.5+) and XMI (v2.5+) specifications are used.
